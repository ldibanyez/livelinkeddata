Live Linked Data is a set of tools to make Linked Data writable with SPARQL
Update 1.1 Two versions are currently supported: SU-Set: Based on Conflict-Free
Replicated Data Types and tailored to full replication scenarios, guaranteeing
eventual consistency. TM-Graph: Based on provenance semirings, supports full and
partial replication, guaranteeing Self-Maintenance of the views defining the
partial replication. (Eventual consistency in the case of full views)
